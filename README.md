<h1 align='center'> Feed Comparison for <em>A. mexicanus</em> </h1>

## Business Case

As a fixture in the cavefish community, Mysis shrimp is used as both a breeding and growth supplement. Unfortunately, when comparing the nutrition to a dry diet, there is a large difference in protein, lipid, and moisture content.  Protein and lipid levels are recommended to be at least 45% Sealey et al. (2009) and 10-15% Sabina et al. (2016) for growth and breeding, respectively.
<br>

<br>

Our facility team has also found fish carcasses, plastics, and other unidentifiable items within the frozen packages. This places a question on the biosecurity practices, critical in a laboratory environment.
<br>

When considering an optimal diet for laboratory fish, Lawrence et al. (2015) quotes â€œ[an optimal diet] is one that efficiently promotes definition and stability in nutritional profile, biosecurity, and maximal performance (growth, survival, and reproduction). While both biosecurity and nutrition are discussed above, the maximal performance of Mysis versus a dry diet is still unknown.
<br>
 
The stakeholders should also consider the indirect & direct costs of Mysis. As a natural resource, it is costly, the quality is variable, and it is time-consuming. The technicians devote an extra 3-4 hours per week preparing and feeding out this feed. 
 <br>
 
We will use a standard dry feed in our study. It poses a lower risk to biosecurity, provides optimal nutrition, and requires minimal time for preparation. To convince the stakeholders of its viability, this study will focus on the above performance metrics using Mysis and dry feed.
<br>

 The project objectives are to:
 <br>
 
  1. Raise A. mexicanus on a dry feed and compare the growth rate and survivability to fish raised on the traditional Mysis feed
  2. Compare the embryo fecundity of adult broodstock raised using this alternative feed.

## Executive Summary

### Data Collection and Wrangling:
<details open>
<summary>Show/Hide</summary>
<br>
 
This phase involved a considerable amount of planning as the data was collected firsthand. This reduced the need for data cleanup after collection. The features to collect would be length, mass, census, viable embryos, and total embryos. As the reduction of stress is important for biological experiment, data was collected under anesthesia. 
<br>
 
The largest roadblock was counting embryos within the timeframe, budget, and precision. This project used subgroup estimation, providing consistent numbers with reasonable accuracy. If this pilot project warranted a publication, a more robust counting method would be performed. This decision was made based on the needs of the experiment.
<br>
 
Cleaning the data included refactoring data types, simplifying feature names, and removing features no longer necessary. Recoding was performed on dates and tank locations due to multi-day testing and bulk moves throughout the experiment. This allowed for interesting mutate coding: 
<br>

 ```
 df_growth <- df_growth %>%
  mutate(Tank_Location = recode(Tank_Location, !!!setNames(third_tank_locations, first_tank_locations)))
 ```
